# Python nmap

Scripts are example of use of python nmap and possibility to integrate it with other python module like Metasploit or ServiceNow. Alone it can provide clear report, without needed to parser or formatting it after scan finished. Script also improve speed and reliability by scan phases and some other additional functions.

List of scripts:
1.	cisco_SIE_Scan.py - Discovery Cisco Smart Installer vulnerability and gathering SNMP info from vulnerable device.
2.	SMB_info_scanner.py - Discovery devices with open 445 and 139 ports and gathering OS and SMB protocols info.
3.	Network_share_scanner.py - Discovery device with open 445 and 139 ports listing all shares on device and listing max 10 files from each discovered share.
4.	Nmap_vuln_scanner_ServiceNow.py - Discovery devices vulnerable for selected nmap script for example ms17_010 (Wannacry) and gathering SMB info about OS and domain . Script is checking if there is already open ticket for that host in ServiceNow if not, it will create new. If ticket is resolved but  vuln still exist on the host, script will reopen ticket. 
5.	Nmap_Metasploit_Scanner_Vuln.py - Discovery devices using nmap and scaning them using Metasploit vulnerability scanner , if devices is vulnerable script will gather SMB info about OS and domain . List of vulnerable IP are recorded in Metasploit DB.
6.	Nmap_Metasploit_Scanner_Vuln_Threads.py â€“ Very Quick and Fast  scanner to discovery devices by scanning of subnets or IPs from file and scanning them against vulns for example like CVE-2019-0708 "BlueKeep" using Metasploit modules . If devices is vulnerable script will gather SMB info about OS and domain .Script is using multiple threads to speed up scan . Lists of vulnerable devices are recorded in csv file .

**Script#4: Nmap_vuln_scanner_ServiceNow.py**

Discovery devices using nmap and scaning them using nmap script to check if are vulnerable,
if devices is vulnerable script will gather SMB info about OS and domain . After detection of vulnerable device script will check if there is ticket in SeviceNow , if not it will create new one or if ticket has been resolved it will reopen it .

Errors and script infos are recorded in /var/log/nmap_vuln_sn.log

Steps:
    
    1. Scanning of subnets or IPs from file for open interesting port
    2. Rescanning when there are probability of missing packets
    3. Checking if device is vulnerable using nmap scripts in provided file
    4. Gathering more information about device using nmap script port is opened and device is vulnerable.
    5. Script is checking site name  from /root/script/site_lists base on discovered ip
    7. After detection of vulnerable device script will check if there is ticket in SeviceNow , if not it will create new one or if ticket has been resolved it will reopen it .
    8. Results are recorded in csv


Usage:
    Nmap_Vuln_Scanner_ServiceNow.py [-h] -i in-subnets_list_csv -l in-vuln_list_csv -o out-file

**Script#6:  SMB_info_scanner_zerologon.py**

Scanner for CVE-2020-1472(Zerologon)

Steps:

1. Script is first scaning for devices with (139 or 445) and 389 ports opened
2. Checking if port 389 is responding with Domain Controler banner
3. Use smb-os-discovery nmap script to gather netbios name for devices 
4. Use gathered netbios name to check if device is vulnerable  CVE-202-1472 using code from https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472 

Todo :

1. implement RDP script for gathering name
2. clean the code

Usage:

SMB_info_scanner_zerologon.py [-h] -i in-subnets_list_csv -l in-vuln_list_csv -o out-file
Additional arguments:
-l True : will scan for LDAP port and only if that port will be open and Domain banner seen then scaning for zerologon vulnerability 
-d True : will be just scaning hosts for name info without scanning vulnerability 



Example of subnets_list_csv:

	10.10.10.10
